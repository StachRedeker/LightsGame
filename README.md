> A modern version of a classic (1972) game: 1D pong. But, more importantly: my first PCB!

As a second year Electrical Engineering student, I wanted to do a project that would show of various skills that I learned during my studies. One of the skills is PCB design, for which I followed an extracurricular course. I also wanted to use the seven segment displays that I have never worked with before. Because at the moment, those were collecting dust in my drawers.

My first thought was to make a [stack calculator](https://orkhanhuseyn.medium.com/what-are-stack-based-calculators-cf2dbe249264). Those stack calculators are interesting devices that are no longer sold, and... also very lame. Then, perhaps subliminally influenced by the latest [Mark Rober video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rsxao9ptdmI), the idea of making my own arcade game came up.

My own arcade game. Sounds awesome! The plan is to 

## Electric circuit design

### Schematic

### Breadboard realisation

## PCB design

## Working version!

## Plans for improvements?
